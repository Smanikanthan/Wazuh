# Wazuh
I implemented Wazuh in an Active Directory environment to centralize log management and enhance endpoint security. The project involved setting up Wazuh, onboarding logs, creating use cases, configuring alerts and dashboards, and integrating threat hunting and intelligence.


In my project, I seamlessly integrated Wazuh within an Active Directory (AD) environment to bolster endpoint security and centralize log management. The deployment involved configuring Wazuh to monitor and analyze logs from AD servers and endpoints, ensuring robust visibility into potential security vulnerabilities. I designed and implemented tailored use cases to proactively detect and address suspicious activities, significantly enhancing the systemâ€™s threat detection capabilities.

In addition, I engineered real-time alerts and interactive dashboards to deliver actionable insights, empowering swift and informed responses to emerging risks. Key elements of the project included integrating advanced threat hunting and intelligence, enabling the identification and analysis of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to preempt potential attacks. This initiative underscored Wazuh's adaptability and efficiency as a SIEM solution, demonstrating its capacity to streamline detection, analysis, and response workflows. By successfully applying Wazuh in an enterprise AD setup, I showcased its critical role in enhancing security operations and safeguarding infrastructure.
